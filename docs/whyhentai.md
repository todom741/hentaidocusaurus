## Purpose

$HENTAI is a token that is designed to empower hentai creators and to encite hentai exposure. Original content is fading due to the evolution of Artificial Intelligence, and it is becoming increasingly more difficult for talented artists to find a plaform they can find exposure on. A strong focus of $HENTAI is to deliver most of its content as `original content` to its fanbase. 

The $HENTAI token is a way for artists and a cryptocurrency ecosystem to collaborate with one another.

## Collaborations

Collaborations with the $HENTAI ecosystem work in two different ways:
* Users of the $HENTAI ecosystem are exposed to new and evolving hentai artists
* Hentai artists get exposure on a platform that allows them to expand their fanbase.

A portion of the circulating supply has been allocated to give to talented artists for exposure on our platform.

As the ecosystem of $HENTAI grows, the collaborations wallet will be reserved for more presigious artists, giving an increasing amount of exposure to $HENTAI.

$HENTAI will always allow artists to host their art on the bot, but will incur a fee without a partnership. The fee will be paid to the development wallet as $HENTAI, which will subsequently be sent to the `burn address`
